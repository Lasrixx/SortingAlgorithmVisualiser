# SortingAlgorithmVisualiser
Graphical visualisation of several sorting algorithms, including selection sort, insertion sort, bubble sort, merge sort, and quick sort.


The array is represented as a bar chart, where the height of the bar is the value in the array. Therefore, a sorted array should appear like a rising slope on the graph.

The user can change several settings of the program, such as the speed the visualisation runs at, and the size of the array to sort.
